    <h1>Father of the Cosmos</h1>
    <p>Carl Sagan was an American astronomer, astrophysicist, cosmologist, astrobiologist, author,
       and science communicator. He is best known for his research on extraterrestrial life,
       including the experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals
       by radiation. Sagan's work with NASA's Mariner, Viking, Voyager, and Galileo missions helped to
       advance our understanding of the planets in our solar system. His ability to communicate complex
       scientific ideas to the public was unparalleled, making him one of the most influential science 
       popularizers of his time.</p>
